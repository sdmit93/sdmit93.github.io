                Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created
                by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
                Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured
                in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an
                orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
                Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of
                adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
                Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson,
                and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin
                story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include
                clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his
                "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider
                webs of his own design.

                When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were
                usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground
                by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret
                identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to
                which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike
                previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain
                America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come
                great responsibility" — a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man
                story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.

                Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which
                is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy
                New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school
                teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers.
                Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap
                plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions
                of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the
                Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter
                Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles
                Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles
                later became a popular superhero in his own right, and was brought into the mainstream continuity,
                where he sometimes works alongside Peter.

                Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared
                in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live action television series,
                syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in multiple series of films. The character was first
                portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which
                ran from 1974 to 1977. In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire, Andrew
                Garfield, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and
                Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), with Johnson reprising
                the role in its sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023). Reeve Carney starred originally
                as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. Spider-Man has been
                well received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most
                popular and iconic comic book characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all
                fiction.

            <h2 id="history">Publication history</h2>

                <strong>Creation and development</strong><br>
                In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was
                casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage
                demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As
                with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was
                missing in comic books. In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime
                fighter the Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
                stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he
                has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
                Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose
                "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name
                "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. He also decided to
                insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red
                and blue costume which starts with an "S" and ends with "man" (although artist Steve Ditko intended
                the character to have an orange and purple costume). At that time Lee had to get only the consent of
                Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in
                detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections. Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man
                tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the
                science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing
                Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). In particular,
                Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after
                issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man. While this was indeed the final
                issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman ... will appear
                every month in Amazing."
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept and
                approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an
                unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy
                living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby
                "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to
                flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby
                showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it
                badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic". Lee turned to Ditko, who
                developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to
                know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have
                hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan
                would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish
                face. It would also add mystery to the character...
            </p>
            <p>Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby
                to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.[20] As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover
                for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."
            </p>
            <p>
                In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a
                mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up.
                I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal."[25] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio
                with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston,
                recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on
                storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I
                think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."[22]: 14  Ditko claimed in a rare
                interview with Jonathan Ross that the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color
                scheme rather than the more famous red and blue.
