                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                        simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
                        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
                        through the cites of the word in classical
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                        Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
                        Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
                        and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is
                        a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
                        Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                        line in section 1.10.32.
                    </p>

                    <h2>H2 title</h2>

                    <p>
                        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum
                        available, but the majority have suffered alteration
                        in some form, by injected humour, or randomised
                        words which don't look even slightly believable. If
                        you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you
                        need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
                        hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
                        chunks as necessary, making this the first true
                        generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of
                        over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
                        model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum
                        which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
                        therefore always free from repetition, injected
                        humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
