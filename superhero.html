                        Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created
                        by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
                        Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured
                        in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an
                        orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
                        Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of
                        adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
                        Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson,
                        and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin
                        story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include
                        clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his
                        "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider
                        webs of his own design.

                        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were
                        usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground
                        by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret
                        identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to
                        which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike
                        previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain
                        America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come
                        great responsibility" â€” a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man
                        story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.
