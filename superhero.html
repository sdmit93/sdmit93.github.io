                        Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created
                        by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
                        Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured
                        in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an
                        orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
                        Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of
                        adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
                        Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson,
                        and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin
                        story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include
                        clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his
                        "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider
                        webs of his own design.

                        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were
                        usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground
                        by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret
                        identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to
                        which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike
                        previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain
                        America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come
                        great responsibility" — a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man
                        story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.

                        Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which
                        is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy
                        New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school
                        teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers.
                        Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap
                        plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions
                        of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the
                        Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter
                        Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles
                        Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles
                        later became a popular superhero in his own right, and was brought into the mainstream continuity,
                        where he sometimes works alongside Peter.

                        Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] He has appeared
                        in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series, a live action television series,
                        syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in multiple series of films. The character was first
                        portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which
                        ran from 1974 to 1977.[11] In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire, Andrew
                        Garfield,[12] and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and
                        Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), with Johnson reprising
                        the role in its sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023). Reeve Carney starred originally
                        as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[13] Spider-Man has been
                        well received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most
                        popular and iconic comic book characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all
                        fiction.
